# Helm

## Prerequisites
1. To be able to install helm charts we need a kubernetes cluster we can install these charts on.
Make sure you've installed the latest version of [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
1. Afterwards use your OS' package manager to [install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#through-package-managers).
1. We will be creating resources on your local filesystem so you might want to reserve a directory somewhere to use as a working directory during the exercises.
